This repo contains all core `gulp` dev tasks which can be configured and used in any FEAR projects alltogether or individually.

The tasks in this repo are provided in a factory function format for developer convenience, so you can use the functionality but can give any name to the task you create and configure it as much as the Core Task API makes it possible (see examples below).

### **Installation**

To use any of the provided Core gulp tasks, please install the module first:

```
$ npm install --save-dev fear-core-dev
```
then to use:

```js
require('fear-core-dev');
```
